# # üìù Exercise M1.05
# 
# The goal of this exercise is to evaluate the impact of feature preprocessing
# on a pipeline that uses a decision-tree-based classifier instead of logistic
# regression.
# 
# - The first question is to empirically evaluate whether scaling numerical
#   feature is helpful or not;
# - The second question is to evaluate whether it is empirically better (both
#   from a computational and a statistical perspective) to use integer coded or
#   one-hot encoded categories.

# As in the previous notebooks, we use the utility `make_column_selector`
# to only select column with a specific data type. Besides, we list in
# advance all categories for the categorical columns.

# ## Reference pipeline (no numerical scaling and integer-coded categories)

# First let's time the pipeline we used in the main notebook to serve as a

# ## Scaling numerical features
# 
# Let's write a similar pipeline that also scales the numerical features using
# `StandardScaler` (or similar):

# ## One-hot encoding of categorical variables
# 
# For linear models, we have observed that integer coding of categorical
# variables can be very detrimental. However for
# `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` models, it does not seem to be the case as
# the cross-validation of the reference pipeline with `OrdinalEncoder` is good.
# 
# Let's see if we can get an even better accuracy with `OneHotEncoder`.
# 
# Hint: `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` does not yet support sparse input
# data. You might want to use
# `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore", sparse=False)` to force the use of a
# dense representation as a workaround.
