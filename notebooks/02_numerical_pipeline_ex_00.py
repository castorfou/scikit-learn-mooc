# # üìù Exercise M1.02
# 
# The goal of this exercise is to fit a similar model as in the previous
# notebook to get familiar with manipulating scikit-learn objects and in
# particular the `.fit/.predict/.score` API.

# Let's load the adult census dataset with only numerical variables

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
adult_census = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census-numeric.csv")
data = adult_census.drop(columns="class")
target = adult_census["class"]


# In the previous notebook we used `model = KNeighborsClassifier()`. All
# scikit-learn models can be created without arguments, which means that you
# don't need to understand the details of the model to use it in scikit-learn.
# 
# One of the `KNeighborsClassifier` parameters is `n_neighbors`. It controls
# the number of neighbors we are going to use to make a prediction for a new
# data point.
# 
# What is the default value of the `n_neighbors` parameter? Hint: Look at the
# help inside your notebook `KNeighborsClassifier?` or on the [scikit-learn
# website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)

# In[2]:


from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo2', 'KNeighborsClassifier')


# Create a `KNeighborsClassifier` model with `n_neighbors=50`

# In[3]:


# Write your code here.
knc = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=50)


# Fit this model on the data and target loaded above

# In[4]:


# Write your code here.
knc.fit(data, target)


# Use your model to make predictions on the first 10 data points inside the
# data. Do they match the actual target values?

# In[6]:


# Write your code here.
knc.predict(data[:10]) == target[:10]


# Compute the accuracy on the training data.

# In[10]:


# Write your code here.
acc = sum(knc.predict(data) == target)/data.shape[0]
print(f' accuracy {100*acc:0.02f} %')


# Now load the test data from `"../datasets/adult-census-numeric-test.csv"` and
# compute the accuracy on the test data.

# In[11]:


# Write your code here.
adult_test = pd.read_csv("../datasets/adult-census-numeric-test.csv")
data_test = adult_test.drop(columns="class")
target_test = adult_test["class"]

acc_test = sum(knc.predict(data_test) == target_test)/data_test.shape[0]
print(f' accuracy {100*acc_test:0.02f} %')
