    "# Speeding-up gradient-boosting\n",
    "In this notebook, we present a modified version of gradient boosting which\n",
    "uses a reduced number of splits when building the different trees. This\n",
    "algorithm is called \"histogram gradient boosting\" in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously mentioned that random-forest is an efficient algorithm since\n",
    "each tree of the ensemble can be fitted at the same time independently.\n",
    "Therefore, the algorithm scales efficiently with both the number of cores and\n",
    "the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient-boosting, the algorithm is a sequential algorithm. It requires\n",
    "the `N-1` trees to have been fit to be able to fit the tree at stage `N`.\n",
    "Therefore, the algorithm is quite computationally expensive. The most\n",
    "expensive part in this algorithm is the search for the best split in the\n",
    "tree which is a brute-force approach: all possible split are evaluated and\n",
    "the best one is picked. We explained this process in the notebook \"tree in\n",
    "depth\", which you can refer to.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accelerate the gradient-boosting algorithm, one could reduce the number of\n",
    "splits to be evaluated. As a consequence, the statistical performance of such\n",
    "a tree would be reduced. However, since we are combining several trees in a\n",
    "gradient-boosting, we can add more estimators to overcome this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a naive implementation of such algorithm using building blocks\n",
    "from scikit-learn. First, we will load the California housing dataset."
